# Quetzal-1 Telemetry

Quetzal-1 sent a downlink with telemetry every 10 seconds for over 6 months. Throughout its life, and with ground stations all over the world listening via the SatNOGS network, this amounted to over 75,000 packets received!

For science, and novice CubeSat teams, this is invaluable! Are you looking for a reference as to what temperatures a typical 1U CubeSat can reach in LEO? Then take a look at this data! Have you any idea how fast satellites rotate when deployed from the International Space Station's Kibo module? Check out this data!

*The possibilities are endless* :artificial_satellite: :stars:

## Variable description

The [telemetry](./telemetry.xlsx) file is a compilation of all the data received for the satellite, by our own Ground Station in Guatemala, as well as dozens of others around the globe. A description of each column in the dataset is provided in [the variable description](./variable_description.xlsx).
